          Born Aug. 4, 1961, Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S. , 44th president of the
          U.S. (2009–17). Obama graduated from Columbia University (1983) and
          Harvard Law School (1991), where he was the first African American
          to serve as president of the Harvard Law Review.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before winning the presidency, Obama represented Illinois in the
          U.S. Senate (2005–08). He was the third African American to be
          elected to that body since the end of Reconstruction (1877).

          In 1992, Obama married Michelle Robinson, a lawyer who had also
          excelled at Harvard Law. Their daughters, Malia and Sasha, were born
          in 1998 and 2001, respectively. Obama was elected to the Illinois
          Senate in 1996, and then to the U.S. Senate in 2004.

          Some pundits instantly pronounced him a future president, but most
          did not expect it to happen for some time. Nevertheless, in 2008 he
          was elected over Arizona Senator John McCain by 365 to 173 electoral
          votes.

          One of Barack Obama's most significant accomplishments as president
          was health care reform. In 2010, he signed the Patient Protection
          and Affordable Care Act into law.
        </p>
        <p>
          This law became so associated with Barack Obama that it is sometimes
          referred to as "Obamacare." This law is intended to help poor people
          to be able to afford health insurance and to provide quality health
          care for all Americans.
